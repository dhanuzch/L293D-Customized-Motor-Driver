# L293D Motor Driver
This repo consists of a L293D based motor driver compatible with microcontrollers. The main motivation behind this project was because of unavailability of a motor driver that exactly fits in a custom made robot.

## Using Gerber file
Just upload/give this file to online board houses such as JLCPCB or offline board houses, if you are intereseted in printing this PCB.

# Files
 - **[Board](%28https://github.com/dhanuzch/L293D-Customized-Motor-Driver/edit/master/Board/%29)** consists of eagle *project, schematic and board files*
 - **[Images](https://github.com/dhanuzch/L293D-Customized-Motor-Driver/edit/master/Images/)** of board and schematics
 - **L293D_gerber.zip** pre-zipped so it is easy to print the PCBs

## Disclaimer
Using an offshelf L298N motor driver is a better option if you are dealing with motors that use more than 1A.
